# Client application

This section will cover an example client application for a high assurance scenario. The client is based on a fictional bank that allows users to leverage any passkey type, but requires a high assurance passkey for sensitive transactions. This section will cover different user flows, and other UX best practices for guiding users on the appropriate passkeys to leverage.

# Prerequisite knowledge

Before you continue into this section, please ensure that you review the previous section on [web client implementations](/docs/category/web-client). The previous sections provide generic implementation guidance on how to register, authenticate, and manage passkeys using a common web application. From this point on, this section assumes that you know how to call the relying party API, and how to use the `navigator.credentials.create()` and `navigator.credentials.get()` methods.
