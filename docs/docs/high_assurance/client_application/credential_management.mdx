# Credential management

This section will cover how to incorporate credential management into your application. Credential management includes how a user will:

- See the passkeys registered to their account
- Add new passkeys to their account
- Delete passkeys from their account
- Update specific metadata to help them easily management passkeys

## Demonstration

The videos below will demonstrate different credential management scenarios.

This first video will demonstrate how a user will navigate to their account settings page to manage their passkeys

This second video will demonstrate how a user adds a new passkey to their account

This third video will demonstrate how a user can delete a passkey from their account. This will prevent the passkey from being used to authenticate into the account

This fourth video will demonstrate how a user can change the name of their passkey to help them better manage their credentials

## UX Considerations

Below is a list of different user experience notes based on the demonstration above

1. Passkey management should be made simple to the user. Ensure that all passkeys are managed from a single place in your application, preferably in a place similar to where they currently manage their password
2. Ensure that your application includes error messages to help troubleshoot when the add or delete processes fail for an unexpected reason
3. Deleting a passkey using the **delete** will NOT remove the passkey from the device that it is generated on. Please be sure to instruct the user to delete the passkey from both the application and directly from their device (security key, phone, or password manager)
   - Failure to do this will allow your platform to continue to prompt users to authenticate with a passkey that was deleted from a service
4. Never allow a user to edit the passkey's public key directly. Only allow a user to edit a specific set of metadata, such as the nickname of the passkey

## Implementation guidance

Guidance on adding a new passkey to a user's account can be found in the [Registration Flows](/docs/web-client/reg-flow) section found earlier in this guide.

Implementation guidance on presenting all of a users passkeys, updating a passkey's nickname, and deleting a passkey can be found in the [API Client](/docs/web-client/api-client#credential-management-apis) section found earlier in this guide.
