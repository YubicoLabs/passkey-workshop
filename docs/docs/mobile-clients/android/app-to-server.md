# Connecting Sample App to Relying Party

Now that we know how to [deploy and run our backend](workshop-server.md), let us connect our [Android app](https://github.com/YubicoLabs/passkey-workshop/tree/main/examples/clients/mobile/android) to it.

## Dependencies

(retrofit + kx.serial)

## devtunnel and Android

(devtunnel integration per build)

## Hello Relying Party Server

(ping / hello world our server, tls)

## Next Steps

Now that you have seen the hello world message from the internet that actually connects to your laptop, in the [next section](app-as-webauthn.md) we'll explore how to connect the Relying Party and the Android App with a first WebAuthN web call.
