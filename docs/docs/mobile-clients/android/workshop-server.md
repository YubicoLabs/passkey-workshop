# Relying Party for Mobile Developement

In the previous section we described how to install Android Studio and build a simple App. This section will add knowledge to build the backendpart of this workshop to be used with Android.

For more indepth discussion of the Relying Party and what this server should and will do, please follow the [Relying Party](/passkey-workshop/docs/category/relying-party) part of the workshop.

The following paragraphs will highlight how to build the party, without going indepth how it works.

## docker

## devtunnel

## curl

## Next Steps

That was fun, wasn't it. In the [next section](app-to-server.md) we will combine this sections backend with our [previously built](getting-started.md) Android app.
