# Getting Started

In this section, we skip the setup of your Android developement machine: We assume you have read our [simple getting started guide](../getting-started.md) and your system is ready to build and deploy Android applications.

# Banking

(Description of use cases and upcomming flows)


# Next Steps

In the following sections, we will go through individual Banking use cases and explain how an Android app could implement these. We're starting with [App](app.md). If you want to directly jump to the source code, please see [our bank sample](https://github.com/YubicoLabs/passkey-workshop/tree/main/examples/clients/mobile/android/bank).
