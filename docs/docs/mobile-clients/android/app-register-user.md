# Registration

In this section we will explain how our app can use register users using a yubikey and the relying party. In the
following
graphic we see the 'authenticator' (i.e. the Yubikey creating credentials), the client (i.e. out android app mediating)
and the relying party called 'application'.

<img
src={require('/img/reg-flow.jpg').default}
alt="Relying Party Architectural Diagram."
style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

So in order to register the user, we need the Android application to implement the communication to the relying party
next.

## Register with Relying Party

## Create Credentials on Authenticator

## Provide Public Key to Relying Party
