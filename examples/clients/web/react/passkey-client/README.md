# Getting started

This folder contains a sample web client application that will allow you to test various user flows for passkey applications. This sample was developed in React, with stylings from the react-bootstrap project.

It is highly recommend that you deploy the client through our deploy script, by following the instructions on our [deployment page](https://yubicolabs.github.io/passkey-workshop/docs/deploy).

Once the application is deployed, you may access the web client at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
