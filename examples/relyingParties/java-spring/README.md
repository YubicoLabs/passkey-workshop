# Getting started

This folder contains a sample relying party application that will allow you to process, store, and validate passkeys.

It is highly recommend that you deploy the relying party through our deploy script, by following the instructions on our [deployment page](https://yubicolabs.github.io/passkey-workshop/docs/deploy).

Once the application is deployed, you may access the applications API documentation at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
