<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Passkeys are the long awaited replacement for passwords. While passwords have been the primary standard in securing user accounts, they are not without issues. Passwords are easy to forget, and easily phishable; which has led to security breaches in various industries such as energy, healthcare, and technology.

What does this mean for your application, and your users? As adoption continues to increase, your users will expect that your application allows them to leverage their passkey supported devices to securely and seamlessly authenticate into their accounts.

This project provides a sample application that demonstrates a full end-to-end passkey solution. The objective is to demonstrate a working prototype to help remove some uncertainty that your development team may encounter on your road to adopting passkeys in your application.

Our example is architected in a way for a developer to take advantage of multiple interfaces so that they may use the database, identity provider, and cloud environment in which they operate in. While the architectural components may differ from app to app, the fundamental logic remains fairly consistent between passkey applications.

Some of the features included in this project are a:

- Working web and mobile client applications to test different passkey user flows
- Working backend application with APIs that can process, store, and validate passkeys sent by any of your clients
- Demonstration on how to enable passkey with an OpenID-Connect identity provider
- Set of best practices for storing passkeys in a database

**Disclaimer** - This project is not meant to act as a production ready solution. Please review and understand the code, then integrate the needed components, and make any modifications based on your security requirements.
